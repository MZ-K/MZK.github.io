                <p>
                    The first line connotes that MZK is out of ideas as to 
                    what he should write. So he just did what any other cultured
                    rapper will do: freestyle!  
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Line 2:</h3>
                <p>
                    The second line means that currently MZK is quite broke
                    and he wishes that he had ten times more money then what he 
                    currently has.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Line 3:</h3>
                <p>
                    In the third line, MZK is talking to his opps(haters). 
                    He asks them if they are mad when they see him shine. It is 
                    worth noting that on first look, it might seem that MZK is capping 
                    about his drip as he just admitted that he is broke. BUT one thing 
                    to remember is that MZK is brown and really smart with his limited 
                    cash. Thus he is a master in copping cheap drip which look expensive 
                    from far away. 
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Line 4:</h3>
                <p>
                    In the fourth line, MZK says that if the opps mess with him
                    too much, he might get mad. He goes on to claim that he might 
                    turn into Bonnie & Clyde(B&C were infamous for some pretty scary stuff). 
                    But it needs to be stated explicitly that MZK is just capping in the 
                    second clause. MZK is too soft to pull off a Bonnie and Clyde. By far 
                    he isn't a real drill rapper and still lives with his parents.
